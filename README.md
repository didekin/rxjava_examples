# rxjava_examples
This repository contains mostly Java code related to the following books:
- 'Reactive Programming with RxJava: Creating Asynchronous, Event-Based Applications', 
  by Tomasz Nurkiewicz and Ben Christensen.
- 'Mastering Lambdas: Java Programming in a Multicore World', by Maurice Naftalin.

The code is not original: it rewrites, expands and clarifies some of the examples on the books. My objective
has been to help me understand them stepping into the code.

Also I have added a few classes to play around with Dave Moten's rxjava-jdbc library. I have used real data
from cities, counties and states in Spain. They are in the resources folder.
